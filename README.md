# HL!UL!SL - Half-Life: Uplink for Steam

* Ported by [Ryan Finnie](https://www.finnie.org/)

## About

HL!UL!SL is an effort to run Half-Life: Uplink from Steam as easily as possible, while leaving it as true to the original demo as possible.  No in-game content has been modified, and the "loading" and menu backgrounds are taken directly from the original Half-Life: Uplink, as opposed to the generic Half-Life screens in Steam.

## Installation

Please see [the mod web site](https://www.halflifeuplink.com/hlulsl) for installation instructions.
