- ABOUT -
SteamLink is an effort to run Half-Life: Uplink from Steam as easily as
possible, while leaving it as true to the original demo as possible.  No
in-game content has been modified, and the "loading" and menu
backgrounds are taken directly from the original Uplink, as opposed to
the generic Half-Life screens in Steam.

- INSTALL -
